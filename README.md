## 🧠 Project Proposal

**Problem:**
Most task management apps focus only on raw productivity — completing more tasks regardless of personal limits.
This often leads to burnout and poor workload balance.

**Solution:**
TimeNest introduces a balanced productivity approach. Each task is assigned an 'energy weight', and users can track their daily energy capacity.
This allows better planning, prevents overcommitment, and encourages sustainable productivity.

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT + bcrypt
- CORS + custom middlewares

**Deployment:**
- Vercel (frontend)
- Render or Railway (backend)
